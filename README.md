# PyCon Project

A simple Vite-based website for PyCon events.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates a `dist/` folder with the production build

4. **Preview production build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This serves the production build locally for testing

## Project Structure

- `public/` - Static assets (SVG icons, etc.)
