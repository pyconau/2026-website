We’re excited to announce that PyCon AU will return in 2026, and we’re headed somewhere slightly warmer… to Brisbane!

Join us in Queensland’s “river city”, **26-30 August 2026 at the Brisbane Sofitel Central**!

Importantly, these dates signal a few changes to the traditional PyCon AU schedule.

* **Workshops** will run prior to the main conference, on Wednesday 26 August 2026.
* **Specialist Tracks and Main Conference** will now run on Thursday, Friday and Saturday 27-29 August 2026.
* **Development Sprints** will run on Sunday 30 August 2026.

It’s too far out to announce specific schedule details, including the ‘arrangement’ of specialist tracks within that three day block. We are, however, signaling that we’re open to changes for how specialist tracks run. Depending on what specialist tracks run, and our overall program (via CFP), Specialist tracks may all run on one day (as per previous PyCon’s AU), or they may be scheduled across several days. The latter would allow attendees to attend more than one specialist track which has not previously been easy to achieve.

Alongside our dates & venue announcement, [a limited number of early bird tickets are also available today](/posts/early-bird-tickets-available) for full-conference Contributors, Professional and Enthusiast ticket types.

This is the first time since 2019 that a PyCon AU host city and dates have been announced a year ahead. This also gives us lead time to hear your feedback, iterate on changes, and refine our plans as the conference dates approach! It also means there’s a lot of details about the conference that are still to be worked out and published - so watch this space!
