Today we’re excited to open our call for Specialist Tracks!

A specialist track is a one day focused mini-conference run as part of the overall PyCon AU program. A track typically focuses on a more niche or specialist topic within the broader Python ecosystem and industry. It can be a particular tool or framework (like Djangocon in 2019, 2023), a particular field (like Scientific Python in 2024, 2025) or a particular industry (like Education, 2015-2025).

While we’d love existing tracks to return (and several will), we’re also looking for new topics and themes. If you’ve never run a track before, the 2026 conference team is ready and raring to help you bring your track idea to life.


To learn more about running a specialist track in 2026, please visit the [specialist tracks](/specialist-tracks) page and download our track organiser companion guide PDF.

We’re also hosting two office hours calls:
* Tuesday 16 December 2025 at 6pm AEDT ([ics](/files/track-office-hours-december.ics))
* Thursday 15 January 2026 at 6pm AEDT ([ics](/files/track-office-hours-january.ics))

These are open discussion forums where you can bring your ideas or questions and the organising team will help offer advice or feedback. Office hours will be hosted in the Python Austalia Community Discord - you can join that community via [pythonaustralia.org](https://pythonaustralia.org)

Our call for tracks closes **11:59pm AEDT 23 January 2026**.

We plan to hold a welcome briefing for shortlisted tracks the week after, paving the way for an early and longer CFP from February (see also [our conference roadmap](/posts/2026-conference-roadmap)).

Go questions? Got a half formed idea? We’d love to hear from you! Just email  program@pycon.org.au.
