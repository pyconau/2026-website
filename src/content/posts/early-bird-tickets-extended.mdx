Early Bird tickets are selling fast, so don’t miss out on the cheapest tickets for PyCon AU 2026 in Brisbane! Thanks to everyone who jumped in early - your super early commitment is so exciting to see!

Much to our delight, we actually ‘sold out’ our initial allocation of early bird tickets, so we’re extending early bird pricing through to **31 December 2025**.

If you were planning to grab a ticket before the end of the year or were still finalising budgets or travel plans, you haven’t missed out. Now is the time to register, and give yourself the gift of a trip to Brisbane in 2026. ☀️

## Early bird pricing: what you need to know
_Ticket popularity means we're slightly bringing forward some plans previously indicated in the [conference roadmap](/posts/2026-conference-roadmap)._

The second release of early bird tickets in that roadmap, are called "blind bird" (i.e. before the program is published) and we're attaching formal dates and deadlines for these discounted tickets.

* **Early bird tickets** ($100 off) remain available until 31 December 2025
* **Blind bird tickets** ($50 off) from 1 January 2026, until 31 March 2026 or until they sell out.

## Coming soon
Don't forget, our call for [specialist tracks](/specialist-tracks) is still open! Join the next office hours session on **Thursday 15 January 2026**. The Call for Proposals (CFP) will then open shortly after. If you’re thinking about speaking in 2026, this holiday season is a great time to be planning your talk ideas.

Remember, **discounted ticket prices are limited**, and will likely sell out ahead of their 31 March 2026 deadline.


If PyCon AU has been on your list for a while, now’s a great time to lock it in. We can’t wait to welcome you to Brisbane in 2026!
