A few moments ago we announced PyCon AU will be headed to Brisbane in 2026.

Please join us 26-30 August 2026 at the Sofitel Brisbane Central!

To celebrate this announcement, we’re also excited to announce that a limited number of early bird tickets are available TODAY.  Additionally, despite rising costs, we’re also committing to keeping ticket prices the same as in 2025 (which was cheaper than 2024).

Early Bird prices are the cheapest price available for a ticket - so don’t delay, [register today](https://pretix.eu/pyconau/2026/)!

## Ticket Types

We have four pricing tiers available to attend PyCon AU 2026:
* **Contributor**: This ticket is for anyone who can afford to ‘give back’ to the community. This ticket is the same as a professional, plus has optional name recognition as a minor sponsor. Contributors help to fund community programs such as discounted student tickets and financial assistance programs.
* **Professional**: This is for anyone who earns an income using Python. This includes employers who are sending staff to attend.
* **Enthusiast**: Tickets for anyone self-funded, including people who use Python in a hobbyist capacity.
* **Student**: A very discounted price for anyone with a student ID. Student tickets will be announced at a later date.

This is just the beginning of ticket sales, with more ticket types to be made available next year. 

Historically, the conference program is published ‘a few months’ prior to the conference. We’re a fair few months ahead of that timeline right now. That means details about one day tickets, student tickets, workshops and (hopefully) more will be announced at a later date.

Community conferences like PyCon AU rely heavily on early ticket sales. By committing early, the conference has increasing confidence to commit to community benefits like financial assistance and other discretionary costs. So if you're certain you're attending, why not snap up the discount and commit early!
