                For some folks, PyCon AU 2026 will be their first time in
                Brisbane. Welcome! For others, it might have been a few years so
                welcome back! Here are some advice for getting around town.
              </p>

              <h2 id="airport-connections">Airport connections</h2>
              <p>
                Book travel to Brisbane Airport (BNE). The airport has separate
                terminals for international and domestic flights. Both terminals
                have local transport connections for taxi, bus, train and ride
                shares (Uber).
              </p>
              <p>
                Airtrain takes approximately 25 minutes from the airport to
                Central station. The conference is held at the Brisbane Sofitel
                Central, which is directly above Central station.
              </p>

              <h2 id="public-transport">Public transport</h2>
              <p>
                Brisbane has a flat 50c fare for public transport including
                local rail and bus networks (except the AirTrain stations which
                have a separate fee). This extends north to the Sunshine Coast,
                and south to the Gold Coast.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most public transport in Brisbane including rail, bus and
                ferries support tap-and-go payments (Visa, and MasterCard only),
                allowing you to pay your 50c fare with a credit card, or Apple
                Pay, Google Wallet etc. Just tap, and go!
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're staying local to Brisbane CBD during PyCon AU, you
                might find it simpler just to use your card, phone or watch. If
                you're planning to travel further afield, consider a Go card for
                your travel needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: you cannot buy a Go card onboard public transport services
                - so make sure you buy one beforehand.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Sofitel Brisbane Central is directly above Central Station.
                All suburban train services operate through Central. If you're
                travelling on a long distance train from interstate, you'll
                terminate at Roma Street station, 1 stop (or a short walk) away.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tip: There's an entrance to the Sofitel Brisbane Central inside
                Central station, just outside the ticket barriers on the Ann St
                exit side of the station. Follow the escalators and signage up 2
                floors to the hotel foyer.
              </p>

              </p>

              <h3 id="buses">Buses</h3>
              <p>
                Most buses operate via the Queen Street Station precinct
                (underneath Queen Street pedestrian mall), or from nearby stops
                on Ann and Adelaide Streets. We recommend following your local
                maps provider's directions, but most stops are within 5-10
                minutes walk of the Sofitel entrance via Ann St.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tip: Most maps providers will suggest you walk up-hill to the
                official Turbot St entrance of the Sofitel Brisbane Central.
                There's an easier entrance at 280 Ann St, Brisbane.
              </p>

              <h3 id="ferries">Ferries</h3>
              <p>
                Sofitel Brisbane Central is a 15-20 minute walk away from its
                nearest wharf at Riverside Ferry Terminal.
