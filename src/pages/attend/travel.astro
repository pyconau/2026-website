                ✨ <strong>Tip:</strong> There's another entrance via 280 Ann Street,
                Brisbane - we recommend this entrance if arriving via bus, train,
                or walking from the Brisbane CBD.

                Book your flights to Brisbane International Airport (BNE) and
                consider transport options (including discounted AirTrain
                fares). More details on airport connections & offers on this
                page.

              <h3 id="via-bus">via Bus</h3>
              <p>
                Most bus services will operate via nearby Adelaide, Anne or
                Queen Streets and are approximately a 5-10 minute walk away from
                the venue. We recommend using the Ann street entrance noted
                suggested above.
              </p>

              <h3 id="via-train">via Train</h3>
              <p>
                If arriving by train, alight at Central Station, and exit to the
                south towards Ann St exits. There is an entrance to the Sofitel
                Brisbane Central just outside the ticket barriers.
              </p>

              <h3 id="via-long-distance-train">via Long Distance Train</h3>

                Long distance train services (including interstate services from
                Sydney) arrive and terminate at Roma Street Station. You can
                connect to Central station via local train services, or walk
                approximately 10-15 minutes.
              </p>
