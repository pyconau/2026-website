              <p>
                Our call for proposals (CFP) will open in early 2026. We run a
                combined CFP across all specialist tracks and the main
                conference. The CFP will be announced on social media and to the
                mailing list.
              </p>
            </FAQEntry>
            <FAQEntry title="When will the schedule be published?">
              <p>
                We typically take 4-6 weeks after CFP closes to review and
                finalise the conference program. We're aiming for approximately
                May ... but stay tuned for news and details!

                our sponsors. If you would like to run a workshop, or would like

              <p>
                PyCon AU 2026 has not announced details for streaming... yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                We appreciate that streaming is an important aspect of the
                conference for some attendees who cannot make it in person. We
                are evaluating streaming options, including our dependency on
                early sponsorship commitments.
