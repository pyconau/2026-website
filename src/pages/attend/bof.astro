                Birds of a Feather sessions (“BoFs”) are a way for conference
                attendees to self-organise around shared topics and interests.
                These sessions often run for half an hour to an hour, and can
                cover topics as broad as LGBTQIA+ meet-and-greets, microPython
                enthusiasm, Python in games, or sewing pockets into clothing.
                You are limited only by your imagination!
              </p>
              <p>
                BoFs are usually held in the hallways of the conference venue,
                or occasionally in a lecture room if there are no active talks
                at that time (e.g. during lunch breaks). Note that lecture halls
                may not be available during lunch breaks for operational
                reasons—check with our team first.
              </p>
              <h2 id="how-do-i-run-a-bof">How do I run a BoF?</h2>
              <p>Organising a BoF is as simple as three easy steps.</p>
              <h3 id="choose-your-time-and-location">
                Choose your time and location
              </h3>
              <p>
                Choose a place in the conference venue where 10-20 people could
                comfortably gather and hold a discussion without disturbing
                others. We are the only event on level 1 of Pullman Melbourne on
                the Park on Saturday and Sunday, so you are welcome to pick
                anywhere in the foyer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Downstairs in the foyer or bar area is also a good place for
                BoFs.
              </p>
              <h3 id="list-your-bof">List your BoF</h3>
              <p>
                We have a board near the registration desk where you can write
                the topic/theme and location, and pin it to a time on the board.
                It’s helpful to put your name, Discord alias or social media
                handle so that people can contact you with questions (but you
                don’t have to do all three).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also use this board to check what other BoFs are
                running, and you might find you want to merge communities or
                schedule around other sessions.
              </p>
              <h3 id="announce-your-bof">Announce your BoF!</h3>
              <p>
                Share your BoF in the attendee Discord. You can also post about
                your BoF using the #PyConAU hashtag. While careful not to spam
                everyone, it can be helpful to announce your BoF once when
                listing it, and again shortly before gathering (as a friendly
                reminder to anyone who has forgotten or missed your first
                announcement).
              </p>
              <h2 id="bof-etiquette">BoF etiquette</h2>
              <p>
                Please make a note of what other BoFs are running at the same
                time as yours, and try to choose a time and place that does not
                conflict with another BoF. To best include people as they arrive
                we recommend using the <a
                  href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/"
                  >Pacman method</a
                >, which involves leaving a person-sized gap in your standing or
                seating arrangements to give the new person an obvious place to
                be included.
              </p>
              <p>
                Don’t gatekeep - if someone decides to turn up to your BoF, they
                are allowed to be there!
              </p>
              <p>
                Stick to the pre-announced time and place of your BoF. If things
                change (i.e. you discover the space is not available, or you are
                running late), please announce this clearly in the attendee
                Discord and the #PyConAU hashtag.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you would like to organise a dinner with other conference
                attendees, you can do so in the #food-and-drink channel on
                Discord. You can also post about your plans with the #PyConAU
                hashtag.
              </p>
              <p>
                Conferences are a great chance to meet new people! When using
                the conference hashtag or Discord to promote events like
                dinners, breakfasts, or drinks, please make sure to include
                PyCon AU newcomers or people from outside your group of friends
                to the event. If you only want to have a gathering with your
                friends, <strong>please organise this privately</strong>. The
                assumption is that if you use the conference hashtag or Discord
                to talk about your event, it is open to all conference
                attendees.

              <p>
                Please be aware that the PyCon AU <a href="/conduct"
                  >Code of Conduct</a
                > applies to all BoFs and conference-adjacent events. Be mindful
                of your behaviour around other conference attendees, particularly
                if alcohol is being served.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any issues at these events can be reported to the PyCon AU Code
                of Conduct committee and will be treated with the same gravity
                as if they had happened in the conference venue.
